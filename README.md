The Penetration Testing Toolkit serves as an integrated platform combining multiple offensive security tools into a cohesive framework for authorized security assessments. The interactive menu system presents users with numbered options for different modules, maintaining state between operations to build comprehensive test results. The port scanner module creates multiple threads that simultaneously attempt TCP connections to different port ranges, significantly reducing scan time compared to sequential scanning. Each thread operates independently, attempting socket connections with configurable timeout values and updating a shared list of discovered open ports protected by thread locks to prevent race conditions. When an open port is discovered, the scanner attempts to grab service banners by sending protocol-specific probes and reading the response, providing valuable information about service versions and configurations. The brute force module implements protocol-specific attack methods, with SSH attacks using the Paramiko library to establish secure connections and test credentials, FTP attacks utilizing Python's built-in ftplib for compatibility, and HTTP attacks managing sessions and cookies for form-based authentication. The module reads passwords from wordlist files line by line to minimize memory usage, attempting each password while handling various error conditions including authentication failures, connection timeouts, and service unavailability. The network sniffer leverages Scapy's packet capture capabilities to intercept network traffic, parsing packet headers to extract source and destination addresses, ports, and protocol information. This module requires elevated privileges due to the need for raw socket access. The vulnerability scanner performs multiple security checks including SSL/TLS configuration analysis where it connects to common HTTPS ports and evaluates the protocols and cipher suites in use, identifying outdated or weak configurations. Common file discovery uses predefined lists of sensitive paths to identify exposed configuration files, backup files, and administrative interfaces that shouldn't be publicly accessible. The exploit generator produces ready-to-use payloads for various scenarios, with reverse shells crafted for different operating systems and interpreters, ensuring compatibility across diverse target environments. Web shells are provided as minimal code snippets that can be uploaded to compromised servers for persistent access. Throughout all operations, the toolkit maintains detailed logs of activities performed, storing results in a structured format that can be compiled into professional penetration testing reports. The toolkit emphasizes responsible use with clear warnings about legal requirements and ethical considerations, designed exclusively for authorized security testing by professionals with proper permissions.
